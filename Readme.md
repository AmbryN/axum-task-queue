# Threaded task queue with Rust and Axum

Attempt at creating a prototype of task processing queue with the Web Server Axum which uses Threads in order to process tasks in parallel.

## Next steps
- Adding support for querying the status of a Task while being computed : for now only the state of tasks which are in the queue or finished can be displayed.

## Built With

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
